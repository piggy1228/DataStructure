ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  50h



DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Please be concise!
Purpose: to calculate which lane will be the fastest lane;
Method: calculate the average time of 50m in each lane, using the data of each participants
Construct a vector to store all the average time of 50m in one event to estimate the average of each lane.
Disadvantage: the statistics are not very accurate because there are lots of deviation in average 50m.
when the length is longer, the average will be larger. However, it is almost a estimator to compare the lane and their pace.






RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
Paste in a small amount of sample output into this file, or list the
